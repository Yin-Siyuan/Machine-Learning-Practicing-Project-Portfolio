# Machine-Learning-Practicing-Project-Portfolio
A portfolio for practicing machine learning with classic projects 

This repo is built to store my practicing projects. 
In these projects, I want to apply and test the machine learning theories that I've learned, e.g building and training models and model selection, become familiar with the libraries in python that are popular for machine learning, and practice verbalizing findings and ideas.
My goal is to create a portfolio of my projects proving not only my skills in machine learning, but more importantly that I am keep learning and improving over time.
I plan to include 7 projects in this repo/portfolio. Here's the list:
 1. Identify irises.
 2. Forecast sales.
 3. Predict stock prices.
 4. Design a recommendation engine.
 5. Predict house prices.
 6. Identify damaged car parts.
 7. Identify emotions.
